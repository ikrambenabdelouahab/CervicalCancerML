This work compares five machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree (DT). Afterwards, the study continues to enhance the outcome of DT algorithm through balancing the data with Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), selecting the most important features with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and tuning hyperparameters with Grid Search technique. Overall, the combination of Decision Tree classification technique with SMOTE and tuning hyperparameters with Grid Search method presents the most performing model.
